DONE 1) Change the dictionaries in the hiragana.json and katakana.json to hold the characters english sounds
DONE 2) The format should be:
    {
        "Character": "hiragana/katakana",
        "unicode": "\u3048", (example)
        "english": "he" (example)
    }
DONE 3) Maybe make a script that goes through each of the characters and asks the user what sound they make
DONE 4) Maybe add a way to delete certain characters if it shouldn't be used

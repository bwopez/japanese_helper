Goal: Make a quiz program to test hirigana and katakana

- Have a menu to choose what to quiz
- Choose how many questions
    - Every question has a multiple choice of 4 choices
    - If incorrect then save that one for later, add it to the end like Duolingo
- Choose to do time attack
    - Have a high score on time attack
- Each hirigana and katakana character has a corresponding english sound
- Maybe store them in a dictionary or txt file to read later
- Every question will pick 3 random other characters and use their corresponding english sound
    for the incorrect choices while the correct character and sound will be added
